Let's try to program skewness ourselves. The following formula is what we are trying to program

$$
  \text{Skewness } = \frac{\mathbb{E}[(X_i-\mu)^3]}{\sigma^3}
$$


where $\mu$ is the mean or first moment of the variable, $X$, $\sigma$ is the standard deviation; and the numerator is the third (central) moment. This quiz will guide you through the calculation of this quantity. Prior to continuing, let's obtain the same data set in R by typing the following code


```{r}
set.seed(123456)
x <- rnorm(1000)
```

1. To calculate the numerator, we need to know the mean, $\mu$, first. How to estimate it without using `mean()` function in R? We can use the following formula as we did in class before
  
  $$
  \widehat{\mu} = \frac{\sum^{N}_{i =1}X_i}{N}
  $$
  
Write down your R code below that calculates this quantity and save the results in something called `tt`. Also present the actual results. **Hint: Two commands would be useful.** `sum()` and `length()`. You can verify your code in R first. 

```{r}
mu <- 
```

2. Now, let's calculate the numerator by using the corresponding \textbf{sample} analog, which is nothing but the mean of the (new) variable, $(X_i-\mu)^3$. So, let's break it into two pieces, if desired.

    1. Construct a new variable, called `third.moment.var`.
    
```{r}
third.moment.var <-
```
    
    2. Calculate the mean of this new variable, which is the third moment. 
    
    
```{r}
numerator <- <- 
```
    
    
3. Let's then calculate the denominator. We can again divide the tasks.     
    
    1. Note that the standard deviation, $\sigma$, is nothing but the squared root of the variance (or the second moment), so let's calculate the variance here (which would be similar to Question 2.). 
    $$
      \frac{\sum^N_{i=1}(X_i-\mu)^2}{N}
    $$    
    
    
```{r}
variance <- 
```


    2. Take the squared root of the variance. 
    
```{r}
sd <- 
```

    3. We now have all the ingredients to calculate the denominator.
    
```{r}
denominator <- 
```


4. Finally, we can calculate the skewness by typing the following code
    
```{r}
numerator/denominator
```

5. We can compare our results to the one calculated using the `skewness()` in the `moments` package. 

```{r}
library(moments)
skewness(x)
```
