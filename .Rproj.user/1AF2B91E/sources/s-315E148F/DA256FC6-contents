**Instruction:** Do all the following empirical exercises using R. Turn in your R markdown file with answers and supporting tables and graphs, if any. Refer to the R output whenever appropriate when discussing your results. It does not matter which method you use to plot a time series variable.

**Question 1. [Learn How to Obtain and Program Certain Characteristics]**    

\bigskip

As Alex rightly noted after class, we took a hard way to calculate sample averages. This is because we would like to know how we can derive other sample estimators based on a theoretical concept. Suppose that we are interested in the following statistic
$$
\sum_{j=1}^{J} x^j\frac{[f(x^j)]^2}{\sum_{j=1}^{J} [f(x^j)]^2}
$$

where $x^j$ is a distinct value of variable $X$, and $f(x^j)$ is the corresponding probability.In total, we have $J$ distinct values. This is a weighted mean of $x$, but with the weight being much larger for those with larger probabilities. We cannot simply estimate this number by taking the simplistic approach to sum up all the values and then divide it by $N$, the number of observations. But we can use the definition above to program it. Let me walk you through this process. You will see that we will put together to use many different commands that we learned before. 

\bigskip

```{r}
set.seed(123456)
x <- sample(1:6, 1000, replace = TRUE)
```


1. Let's find out what the unique values are by using `unique()`, and call it `x.unique`

```{r eval=FALSE}
x.unique <- unique(x)
```

2. Lets' sort our unique values, and call it `x.sorted`

```{r eval=FALSE}
x.sorted <- sort(x.unique)
```

3. Calculate the probability mass function (then we automatically have $f(x^j)$ for every $x^j$), and call it `x.pmf`. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
x.pmf <- prop.table(table(x))
```


4. Generate a new vector that is $[f(x^j)]^2$, the square of each probability, and call it `x.pmf2`.

```{r}
x.pmf2 <- x.pmf^2
```

5. Calculate the sum $\sum_{j=1}^{J} [f(x^j)]^2$ in the denominator, and call it `x.pmf2sum`

```{r}
x.pmf2sum <- sum(x.pmf2)
```

6. Now sum up the (element-wise) product of every distinct value, $x^j$ and $\frac{[f(x^j)]^2}{\sum_{j=1}^{J} [f(x^j)]^2}$

```{r}
sum(x.sorted * x.pmf2/x.pmf2sum)
```
